                         README File for Assura LVS/RCX
		     =====================================

 I. Files/Directories related ;
    This deck is general LVS and RCX combo deck which for 018 MMRF process.

     *Following are the descriptions for files of each directory:

   - LVS related
  	extract.rul     - Device extraction file 
  	compare.rul     - LVS compare rule file
  	LVS.rsf         - sample RSF 
	source.add	- subckt netlist to prepend to output of CDL netlist
			  for LVS checking (used in CDL flow only)
			  
   - RCX related (RC techfiles)  
	  p2lvsfile         - layer mapping file for procfile 
	  capgen.cmd	    - script for capagen -C

II. How to create a new RCX reference file 

   Step1: To get the lvsfile:
          After finished the LVS check, the rundir/runame.xcn file is for RCX lvsfile.
	  %> copy rundir/runame.xcn lvsfile

   Step2: run capgen.cmd file
          %> capgen.cmd

III. Assura switch setting:
     avSwitch( "Skip_Soft_Connect_Checks") : Do not check Soft-connect error.
     avSwitch( "extract_dnwdio") : Extract DNW diode devices.
     avSwitch( "spice_extraction" ) : when RCX extract spice netlist, turn-on this switch.
     avSwitch( "ZERO_NRDS" ) : set nrd=nrs=0 when run RCX extraction flow .
     avSwitch( "NW_RING" ) : If turn on it, it will not check soft-connect check for nwell ring 
                             and psub(rwell) inside.

     You can set switch in LVS.rsf (for batch mode) or choose switch button(for gui mode).

     example: (in LVS.rsf)

     ?set ("spice_extraction") --> turn on switch by take off ";"
     ;?set ("spice_extraction") --> turn off switch by put on ";"

IV. Selecting Proper LVS Deck 

    The Main_Deck directory is based on user-defined process settings to eliminate any unnecessary 
    switch setting during LVS. These settings include:
      Mimcap: 1P0, 1P5, 2P0
      Top Metal Thickness: 8K, 20K, 40K
      MOS model: MAC, nonMac
    Since user can only use only one of these settings at any given time, the LVS deck has been 
    preset based on the desired user settings. For example, if design utilizes 2.0fF mimcaps and
    MOS macro models, then user can just obtain files in the 2P0_MAC folder and directly run LVS.
    If design utilizes 1.0fF mimcaps and ultra thick 40k top metal, then user can use the LVS 
    files in the 1P0_40K folder. It may be that only one or two settings are available for the user
    to select from. Please use the key above to identify proper LVS deck.

Common Note: 
     1. First refer to the notice messages and status logs in the head of 
	each command file.

     2. The sample RSF file is provided as a template to run Assura LVS 
	from Unix command line. Users are encouraged to edit this file 
	as needed.

     3. If you find you CDL netlist already contains 'empty subcircuit' statments,
        please don't prepend the 'source.added' file again. Otherwise, LVS tools
        will complian those subckt names are duplicate defined!

     4. In some Assura version (under 314), if you select "res blocking" choice when you run Assura
        RC extraction of RF devices (ex: mimcap_rf), it will occur an error that the connectivity of
	RC extraction is incorrect. And this open connectivity situation will cause wrong 
	post-simulation. And this error will be fixed on updated Assura version. 

     5. Please do not give minus or zero value in parameters of devices, or it will be failed or crash 
        when LVS run.
 
*******************************************************************************
Usage of 'source.added' file:

  Before running LVS (for cdl flow only, if need):

1. netlist your circuit as 'out.cdl' (cdl format)
2. cat source.added out.cdl > chip.cdl ;makes the final netlist for LVS checking
