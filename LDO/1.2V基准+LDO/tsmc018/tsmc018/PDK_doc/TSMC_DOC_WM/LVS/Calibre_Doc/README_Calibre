LVS/RCE DECK INTRODUCTION AND USER GUIDE

I. INTRODUCTION

    The command file that you just downloaded is a combination of LVS/RCE
deck. You can run LVS or RC extraction using the same deck with minor
modification (usually by setting the switch). 
Currently, the combo deck is separated into two files:
The device extraction rules file and the parasitic extraction rule file (the add-on deck #1).
Following are the descriptions for these files:

    a. The device extraction rules file :
          This file usually contains the device extraction
       rules for this process.

    b. the add-on deck #1 :
          This file contains the parasitic extraction information. Currently,
       the capacitance/resistance specification statement output by XRC
       is included in this file. Generally speaking, this file is for RC
       extraction purpose only and has nothing matter to LVS. When running LVS,
       you can ignore this file.

  To correctly run the LVS/RCE on your design, you need to create a complete
combo deck. The detailed description of how to create a complete combo deck is
described in the following section.


II. USER GUIDE

    Since the complete combo deck is separated into a "main deck",and one 
"add-on decks," you need to create a complete combo deck before 
running a LVS check or RC extraction. In this section, we will guide you through how
to create a complete combo deck. At the same time, we will also demonstrate how to set 
the switch to make the complete combo deck into a LVS deck or RCE deck.


  A. Creating a complete deck for LVS

    Procedures:

      Step 1. Please download the most update "LVS/RC combo deck" from TSMC-online system.

      Step 2. Unpack the compressed file (from step 1)
              The file "LVS_RC_Calibre_0.18um_MIX_RF_1p6m_1.8V+3.3V.13a" is "the LVS/RC combo file" for this process.
	      
      Step 3. Set the switch by undefining the "RC_DECK" variable. In the "complete command file" 
              obtained from step 3, find the line "#DEFINE RC_DECK" and undefine it by adding a leading
	      double slash. Your command file will look like this:

              //#DEFINE RC_DECK   => this means the deck is an LVS main deck file
	     			    (this is a default setting)
	      
      Step 4. Finally, run LVS on your design using the newly modified command file from step 4.
 

  B. Creating a complete combo deck for RCE

        The processing steps for creating a complete combo deck for RC extraction
     are similar to creating that for LVS, except for the "add-on deck #1" and
     switch setting. Following are the steps to create a complete combo deck for RCE:

     Step 1~2 : Follow above steps 1~2 for getting a LVS/RC combo deck for LVS.

     Step 3 : Set the switch by defining the "RC_DECK" variable. In the "LVS/RC combo file"
              obtained from above step 3, define the "RC_DECK" variable in your file.
              Your command file will look like this:
	      
               #DEFINE RC_DECK    => this means the deck is a RCE command file

     Step 4 : Download the xCalibre RC technology file (add-on deck #1) 
              corresponding to the process you used from TSMC online.

     Step 5 : Unzip the zip file from step 4 and extract the capacitance rule
              statement file (rules) and resistor statement file (File name looks like
	      this: "t018s6ml.res").

     Step 6 : Use the Unix command 'cat' to combine these two files into a
              new rule file, and rename the new rule file "rules."

              %cat t018s6ml.res >> rules

	      Of course, concatenation in a text editor will also work.
               
     Step 7 : Finally, run RCE on your design using the newly created command
               file from step 3. ***Make sure the "rules" file 
               obtained from step 6 is also located in the working directory***.
  
  C. Extracted the DNW-PSUB diode
        By default, the two diodes, PWDNW and DNWPSUB, are not extracted in this command  
     file.  Please turn on the switch, "#DEFINE DNW_DIODE", 
     to apply the extraction of these two diodes.

III. Example on setting switch

    A. Controlling "the complete command file" is LVS deck or RC extraction deck  
       In "the complete command file", if the switch is set as:
    
       #DEFINE RC_DECK       => this means it is an RC extraction deck

      //#DEFINE RC_DECK      => this means it is an LVS deck
                                (This is the default setting)

IV. Selecting Proper LVS Deck 

    The Main_Deck directory is based on user-defined process settings to eliminate any unnecessary 
    switch setting during LVS. These settings include:
      Mimcap: 1P0, 1P5, 2P0
      Top Metal Thickness: 8K, 20K, 40K
      MOS model: MAC, nonMac
    Since user can only use only one of these settings at any given time, the LVS deck has been 
    preset based on the desired user settings. For example, if design utilizes 2.0fF mimcaps and
    MOS macro models, then user can just obtain files in the 2P0_MAC folder and directly run LVS.
    If design utilizes 1.0fF mimcaps and ultra thick 40k top metal, then user can use the LVS 
    files in the 1P0_40K folder. It may be that only one or two settings are available for the user
    to select from. Please use the key above to identify proper LVS deck.
